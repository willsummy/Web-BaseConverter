we need a fillable form that only accepts integers
drop downs for starting base and base to convert to
2-36 for each

clear button
convert button

clear method to clear form

convert method to produce the converted value
convert button runs convert method, then sets output field to product

convert method takes in user input from field
takes in starting and ending base values from drop downs
does math based off of that
